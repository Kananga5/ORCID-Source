*1.4.1.2.9. key : wath is a proof: 
Definition, a proposition is a statement communication that is either true or false ,,,  the first is true second ..
Proposition,1.1.1.2+3=5
Proposition 1.1.2.1+1=4,,
- statement such as Romeo  give circumstances it five o'clock , or stock market will rise to morrow..
- unfortunately it is not always decide if a claimed proposition is true or false ..
-:claim  no non-negative ,integer n the value of n 2 ,c n ,c141 , 
- a prime is integer greater than ,# that is not divisible ,, ..
-; numerical experiments check ,, ,,checking D 39 and confirm ,0 39 ,/ D 1601 is prime which isn't not so claim false ....
-;wath is proof for compulator science scientist some of the most important important things to prove are the correctness of programs and systeme wether a program ,system does its  supposed to programs are notoriously buggy and there's growing community of research ,case CPU child ,now routines used leading manufacturer to proved  correctness avoid some notoriouse past mistakes developm mathematics methods to verify programs system remains an active research area ..
- predicate : a predicate can be understood as proposition whose truth depends on the value ,of one one more variable , so ,n is a perfect square ,decrib ,can say it's true or value until you know wath the value variable knhappened..
- proposition ,4 is a perfect square Rembert ,4 is perfect ,square  nothing's say that  has proposition is true ,if value were ,5 you would get false proposition ,5 is a perfect square, prepositions predica,
The axion method the standard methods procedure for establishing truth in mathematics was invented Euclid ,,
1.4 our axiom : pair of points proposity simple additional proposition ,by proofs is sequence of logical deduction from axiom and previously proved statement that conclude , questions ,you probably wrote , important true proposition are called theorem, a lemma is preliminary proposition use for proving later proposition ,A corrilary is proposition that follow in just few logical step ,logic deduction ,logical deduction or inference rules to prove new proposition using 
-

	
	
- previously proved ones ,a fundamental inference rules is modus poneus rules ,
Tigger proof that O implies ,A is a proof of ,A inference rules are sometimes written ,,
Rules P implies A,A implies R,P implies ,R one the other hand non rule ,not rule,not ,implies not ,Q P implies , is not sound ,if P is assigned ,T and A is assigned ,F the antecedents true and the consequences is not , 
-1.5.Proving an implication pattern of proof in principle a proof can sequence of logical deduction form axiom previously proved statement from axiom conclu with questions..
- Proving an implication proposi to ion of the form" ifP,then Q"are called implications this implications is often rephrased as " P IMPLIES Q" here are ,
Quadratic formula) if ax^2,c BC,CD ,,0 and a ,0 then ,XD ,, b^2-4ac= 2a
Goldblach conjecture ,if n is an even integer greater than ,2 n is sum of two primes ,
If. 0 ,x ,2 the X^3, 4x,C1>0 there couple of standard proving an implication ,,
Wath is proof the inequality certain..
Proof contrapositive and then state ,
- proced as in method , theorem ,is irrational then P ,r is also ,A number is rational,m= n for integer ,m and n if ,So , proof we prove the contrapot if ,P is rational , squareing both ,, 
-"statement," IFFQ" is equivalent to the two statements," P IMPLIES. Q" and 
" IMPLIES P" ..
1.write ," we prove P prove P implies A" do this by one the method 
-write ," first we show ,P implies A" 
3 write now again ..
- method , construct a chain of Iffs ,in order to prove that is true off Q is true ,prove is equivalent to a third statement and so forth until you reach ,A this method something requirements more ingenieure, is definitely..
- the standard deviations of sequence of value x1;X2;:::::;xn is defined to be 
X1_/2c. X2_2/2c__c..
Theorem standay deviations of sequence of value ,x1 ,xn is zero ,off all the value are equal to ..
- proof by case : square of real number are always no negative ,so evry term on the left hand ,side of equation this means ..
- evry ...- 
- proof by cases breaking a complicated proof into cases and proving each case separately is a common useful proof ,let agree either a club mer or not if evry pair of people in group has met we ll call the group has not met we call it group stranger ,
- proof the proof is by Cass analysis let ,x denote one of  the six  least ,3 have met x .
2 among the 5 people at least ,3 have not met we have to sure that a least one of two case must hold ,,
-the implies that the theorem hold ,case 1
Case 2 suppose that a least 3 people's did not meet x
This case also splits into subcase 
Case 2,@ evry pair among those people mer each other ,then these people are a club of at least 3 people si the theorem hold this subcase 
Case ,2.2 : some pair among those people have not met each other then that pair together with x form  group of at least ,3 stranger si the theorem hold in this subcase this implies that theorem alsi hold in case 2 and therefore hold in all case ,
- proof by contradiction in a proof by contrast on indirect proof you show that if a proposity were false ,alway approach ,,name suggests  indirect proof cal a little convoluted ,si 
Method in order to prove a proposition by contradiction .
1.write " we use proof by contradiction"
2.write" suppose O is false .
3.deduce something know to be false a logical contradiction .
4. Write " this a contradiction therefore..
- good proof in practice ,
We ' ll prove by contradicttthat p ..2 is irrational remember that number is rational if it equal to ratio of integer for example ,
3:5. , D7=2 and.  0:111 ___ D are irrational number ,,.
- creating  a good proof is a lot like creating best work of artfact ,it takes practice experience to write proof that merit such praises ..
-computef systet ,when algorithm and protocols only mostly with ,due to reliance and hand waving argument  the result  can range from problematic to catastrophic therac machine provided therapist 
- involved a single faulty commands computer ...- class problem 
- precisely identify explain mistake in this bogus proof,prove correctly ,evry positive real number has square root positive other negaty , property , identify exactt where the bugs are each of the following bogus proofs ,8 ,a bogus. Claim ,1= 8> 1=4 bogus proof  3> 2

4.1 .12.15..1.10nline Retail and E-commerce in the Renewable Energy Sector
This course explores the intersection of online retail and e-commerce with renewable energy. Students will gain expertise in leveraging digital platforms to promote and sell renewable energy solutions, products, and services. The course covers market trends, customer behavior, e-commerce strategies, and sustainability practices.
1.2 Introduction to E-commerce in the Renewable Energy Sector
An overview of the e-commerce landscape specifically tailored for renewable energy products, services, and solutions.
In 2025, the commerce landscape will be more interwoven with sustainability than ever before. Based on the content extracted from the provided article, here is a Key Takeaways section: any firms are innovating in the ways in which they sell products online. Firms can make use of a range of digital technologies, including artificial intelligence, blockchain, the Internet of Things and autonomous delivery devices like drones or robots to facilitate e-commerce, while new payment services like mobile money and digital wallets widen the scope of e-commerce.
Online platforms match buyers and sellers, including across borders, to facilitate online transactions. Online platforms enable more and different products to be sold, but often require mechanisms that match buyers and sellers, boost trust among unknown e-commerce participants, and encourage more firms to enter the marketplace. Also growing are subscription service business models (e.g. music streaming). Such models enable the continuous provision of products in exchange for recurring payments. Consumers may find such models convenient, particularly for goods that require replenishment, while firms may benefit from lower marginal costs, reduced frictions and longer-term revenue streams. A third business model includes those that use offline or physical features to sell online (e.g. omni-channel models). From automated supermarkets to skip-the-queue mobile application ordering, more firms are experimenting with mechanisms that enable e-commerce while removing the frictions associated with offline ordering.
1.3 Understanding the Renewable Energy Market
Insights into the renewable energy market, including key players, trends, and consumer
Targeted, flexible and co-ordinated policies can unlock the potential of e-commerce 
The rise of the Internet in the 1990s fuelled the growth of e-commerce and put it on the agenda of policy makers worldwide. But the rapid pace at which digital transformation has progressed and the dynamism of e-commerce markets requires a fresh look at policy frameworks to ensure that they support further e-commerce innovations. In particular, three policy considerations should be taken into account.
1.4. E-commerce Strategies for Renewable Energy Products
Effective e-commerce strategies tailored for marketing and selling renewable energy products online.
E-commerce must be better measured and e-commerce policy more co-ordinated to unlock the potential of e-commerce for all 
Technological change is altering the e-commerce landscape, and these new developments affect policy frameworks along several dimensions. Some of the challenges identified in the early days of e-commerce remain relevant (e.g. related to data protection), but new challenges have also emerged (e.g. the rise of tradeable services and their implications for trade policy). These developments require a holistic approach to e-commerce policy making, including co-operation and collaboration across policy areas. In particular, consumer protection, taxation, competition, trade and environmental policies should be co-ordinated, including at the highest levels of government and at the global level, to ensure that trade-offs are carefully considered and to guard against unintended consequences of misaligned policy action. Many such rules are local, which further underscores the need for a consistent and co-ordinated whole-of-government approach to e-commerce policy making at all levels of government.
At the same time, a lack of e-commerce data limits the ability of policy makers to determine the need for policy action and calls for more focus on the e-commerce measurement agenda. On the one hand, the harmonisation of available data on e-commerce across countries (e.g. ICT usage surveys) should continue and adjust in response to an evolving technological environment. Changing technologies and business models might eventually also warrant a reconsideration of the current OECD e-commerce definition. At the same time, the limitations of ICT usage surveys requires governments to foster the inclusion of e-commerce related questions in other official data sources, such as structural business or household expenditure surveys, as well as the use of non-standard data sources.
Targeted policies can address e-commerce divides 
Those who do not or cannot engage in e-commerce may find themselves on the wrong side of a potentially persistent and harmful digital divide as digital transformation progresses. SMEs lag behind larger firms in terms of e-commerce participation, but policy can help by addressing bottlenecks that might result in high costs associated with delivery and returns. Reducing regulatory uncertainty and fostering an inclusive business environment can help small firms trade online and across borders, as well as integrate successfully with larger service providers, such as online platforms.
E-commerce gaps for individuals remain significant along a range of dimensions, including education, income, age and gender, as well as for those living in rural areas. Factors that reduce participation of these groups are often related to economic and social conditions that reach far beyond e-commerce, including rural-urban divides, income distribution, unequal access to education and an aging society. With regard to e-commerce, these conditions may manifest themselves in low connectivity, a lack of digital skills, low levels of trust or a lack of viable payment options, all factors that can be addressed by policy action
1.4 Consumer Behavior in Online Retail
Analyzing consumer behavior and preferences in the context of online retail for renewable energy products.
3.1 Electric power B2B descriptions
The Business-to-Business (B2B) framework within the electric power industry stands as a unique and complex entity, markedly different from the more familiar terrain of consumer focused markets. This distinction is not merely in scale but also in the depth and intricacies of its operations. Predominantly characterized by transactions of substantial magnitude, the electric power B2B sector encompasses a vast array of activities. These range from the procurement of heavy duty equipment in bulk quantities to the formulation and execution of comprehensive contracts that oversee power generation, transmission, and distribution across vast geographical expanses.
The sheer scale and complexity of these transactions give rise to extended sales cycles. Unlike the swift decision-making often seen in B2C scenarios, B2B dealings in the electric power industry are methodical and deliberate. Each transaction, be it a purchase order for machinery or a long-term service contract, undergoes a meticulous process of evaluations. These assessments are not just about cost-effectiveness but also delve into the technical compatibility, long-term viability, and potential scalability of the offerings. Negotiations, often spanning multiple rounds, aim to strike a balance between commercial interests and operational feasibility. Furthermore, the approval processes are multi-tiered, involving various stakeholders from technical experts and financial analysts to top-tier management, ensuring that every decision aligns with the organization's strategic objectives.
In this industry, the products and services on offer are not generic; they are highly specialized solutions crafted to address specific challenges. Whether it's a state-of-the-art transformer, an advanced grid management system, or consultancy services for renewable energy integration, each product or service demands a deep-seated understanding. Stakeholders must grasp not only the technical specifications but also the broader implications of their choices. This includes potential integration challenges with existing systems, adherence to ever-evolving regulatory frameworks, and ensuring compliance with both local and international safety and environmental standards. In essence, every B2B transaction in the electric power sector is a testament to the industry's multifaceted nature, where commercial, technical, and regulatory considerations converge.
3.2 Notations
In this section, we introduce and define the notations that will be used throughout the methodology. This notation serves as the foundation for understanding the data structures, user behaviors, and item attributes, as well as the collaborative filtering approach we use to recommend products to users.
U: Represents the set of all users in the system. Each user is uniquely identified by an index in this set, N represents the number of the users.
I: Denotes the set of all items available in the system. Similar to users, each item is uniquely identified by an index in this set, M represents the total number of the items.
n: Represents the number of categories for individual product attributes.
m: Represents the number of categories for user behaviors.
S (u, v): Represents the similarity between users u and v. This similarity metric is crucial for collaborative filtering, as it determines how similar two users are in terms of their preferences. The basic formula for collaborative filtering is given by Equation 1:
rui=∑v∈US(u,v)rvi    (1) 
Oui, Aui, Bui: these notations denote the order, following, and browsing numbers respectively for user u and item i. They capture different types of implicit feedback from users.
wo, wa, wb: these are the weight ratios associated with order, following, and browsing data respectively. They determine the significance or influence of each type of implicit feedback in the recommendation process. For examples, we can set wo = 1, wa = 0.5, wb = 0.5.
BIu, NBIu: these vectors are behavior numbers varying time, representing the bidding and non-bidding behaviors of user u respectively. They capture unique B2B behaviors that are essential for understanding user preferences in the electric power E-commerce domain.
The foundation of this collaborative filtering approach is based on the principle that users who have behaved similarly in the past will continue to have similar preferences in the future. The notations introduced above will be instrumental in formulating and understanding the mathematical models and algorithms we employ in subsequent sections.
1.5 Digital Marketing for Renewable Energy E-commerce
Best practices for digital marketing in promoting renewable energy products and services online Public policies can support the creation of innovative e-commerce business models 
As digital transformation progresses, new business models will arise in ways that are difficult to predict, but which also challenge traditional policy frameworks. In particular, some regulatory barriers preserve artificial distinctions between online and offline commerce, even as firms increasingly pursue business models that combine both elements. Where local zoning laws prevent multi-purpose use of brick-and-mortar stores, or planning regulations prevent the development of new last-mile logistic solutions, the potential of e-commerce diminishes.
Regulatory approaches to new e-commerce business models should focus on remaining experimental, transparent and flexible. Experimental regulatory waivers have been successfully used to test new technologies like drones and digital payment mechanisms; future applications for e-commerce could include cryptocurrencies and 3D printing. Existing rules could be made clearer to reduce uncertainty for innovative firms. Policy makers should avoid attempting to regulate particular business models. Instead, they should ensure that particular business functions conform with regulatory frameworks, while better accounting for the interlinkages across business functions.
1.6. Sustainable Practices in E-commerce
driven solutions are revolutionizing retail operations by optimizing supply chain management and e-commerce processes. Ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithms play a crucial role in improving vehicle routing, enhancing delivery speed, reducing costs, and minimizing resource use (Revanna & Al-Nakash, 2023; Ushada et al., 2022). In e-commerce, AI scrutinizes user behavior to track browsing patterns, cart additions, and purchase completions. Neural networks like WaveNet refine sales forecasting by analyzing product descriptions, enabling businesses to predict demand and better manage inventory and marketing (Chen et al., 2024). Moreover, deep learning models process clinical and genetic data for improved medical diagnostics, such as early cancer detection (Kumar et al., 2023). Together, these AI technologies create an efficient, adaptive business ecosystem.
Theme 4: AI-Enhanced Shopping Experience
AI is transforming e-commerce by boosting operational efficiency and customer engagement through personalized shopping experiences (Birau et al., 2023; Subbaiah et al., 2024). Machine learning enhances this by accurately predicting customer churn, enabling effective retention strategies (Lee et al., 2024). AI also automates inventory management, reduces costs, and enhances data security (Birau et al., 2023). AI-driven chatbots improve customer service and facilitate cross-border transactions (Meltzer, 2023). By analyzing social media feedback, AI provides actionable insights that help businesses refine strategies and products (Alotaibi, 2023). These tools reshape consumer behavior, making shopping more personalized and increasing retention and sales for e-commerce.

Implementing sustainable business practices within the e-commerce model for renewable energy.
1.7 Case Studies in Renewable Energy E-commerce:
3.3 Fusion of behavioral data
The fusion of behavioral data is a pivotal step in the methodology, aiming to create a comprehensive representation of user interactions on the platform. This section delves into the intricacies of how different types of behavioral data are combined to provide a holistic view of user preferences and activities.
3.3.1 Order, following, and browsing data
These three types of data capture the most direct interactions of users with items on the platform. Order data (Oui) represents confirmed transactions, following data (Aui) signifies items that users have shown interest in, and browsing data (Bui) captures the items that users have viewed or explored.
3.3.2 Weight ratios
The weight ratios wo, wa, andwb are crucial in determining the significance of each type of interaction. They allow us to assign varying importance to different behaviors, reflecting the relative impact of each interaction type on user preferences. For instance, a confirmed order might carry more weight than merely browsing an item.
3.3.3 Bidding and non-bidding data
Unique to the B2B E-commerce landscape, bidding (BIu) and non-bidding (NBIu) data provide insights into the negotiation and decision-making processes of users. These behaviors, while not directly linked to transactions, offer valuable context about user intentions and preferences.
3.3.4 Behavior vectors
The behavior vectors for bidding and non-bidding data are formulated to capture the essence of these unique interactions. By characterizing user similarity through these vectors, we can better understand the relationships and similarities between users based on their bidding and non-bidding behaviors.
The fusion formula for order, following, and browsing data is given by Equation 2:
Fui = woOui + waAui + wbBui    (2) 
This formula ensures that each type of interaction contributes proportionally to the final fused representation based on its assigned weight. A cosine similarity measure is used here to characterize user similarity for the fusion of behaviors, as detailed in Equation 3.
Sf(u,v)=cos(θ)=Fu·Fv||Fu||||Fv||    (3) 
For bidding and non-bidding data, we employ a cosine similarity measure to characterize user similarity Sbid(u, v), Snb(u, v). This metric captures the angle between the behavior vectors, providing a measure of how alike two users are in terms of their bidding and non-bidding behaviors:
The fusion of behavioral data is a multi-faceted process that combines various types of user interactions to create a unified representation. This representation serves as the foundation for subsequent recommendation processes, ensuring that all relevant user behaviors are considered.
3.4 Fusion of item attribute information
The integration of item attribute information is a cornerstone in the methodology, ensuring that the attributes and characteristics of items are adequately represented and factored into the recommendation process. This section elucidates the methods and rationale behind the fusion of various item related data, highlighting the importance of capturing the multifaceted nature of products in the B2B E-commerce domain.
3.4.1 Item attribute vector
Central to the approach is the concept of item attributes. This vector encapsulates various attributes of an item, such as its category, suppliers and other relevant metadata. For each item and each item attribute (e.g. category), we construct a one-hot-vector based on different values of attributes. Hence, the size of item attribute vector IA related to individual item attribute is M × n.
3.4.2 User behavior matrix
With the item attribute vectors in place, we can then construct the user-attribute behavior matrix. Firstly, the overall user behavior vector Bm×M is established with each element representing the number of specific behavior (e.g., order number) for each item. The m is the number of behavior types and M is the number of items. Secondly, through matrix operations Bm×MIAM×n, we can obtain the user specific-attribute interaction matrix Rm×n. Finally, by summing up each column of the matrix, we can obtain a vector representing the behavioral performance of each user for each attribute. Therefore, the user-attribute behavior matrix MN×n is established. Mapping user behaviors onto the item attribute vectors, we can capture the nuanced interactions between users and the multifaceted attributes of items.
3.4.3 Similarity computation
The fusion of item attribute information and user behavior culminates in the computation of similarity scores. The item-attribute similarity Sitem(u, v) extracted from MN×n, measure the likeness between two users based on their item attribute information (e.g. item category, suppliers) and the aggregated user interactions (e.g., order, following, browsing). The similarity scores play a pivotal role in the recommendation process, guiding the system toward items that are contextually and attribute wise similar to the user's preferences.
To compute the similarity between users based on their item attribute vectors and user interactions, we employ the cosine similarity metric. In this paper, Sitem(u, v) is composed of four parts, mainly the three category (primary, secondary and tertiary item category) similarities Sitemcategory(u, v) and one supplier similarity Sitemsupplier(u, v).
In essence, the fusion of item information is a meticulous process that aims to bridge the gap between raw item attributes and structured data representations. By integrating item characteristics with user behaviors, we ensure that the recommendation system is both context-aware and attribute-sensitive, leading to more accurate and meaningful recommendations.
3.5 Fusion of behavioral data and item information
The recommendation method forms the crux of the approach, leveraging the fused behavioral data and item information to generate personalized product suggestions for users. This section delves into the intricacies of the recommendation algorithm, elucidating the steps and logic that drive the generation of tailored recommendations.
3.5.1 User similarity computation
At the heart of the recommendation method is the computation of user similarity. By comparing the behavior profiles of different users, we can identify patterns and preferences that are shared among them. This similarity metric, denoted as S(u, v), provides a measure of how alike two users are in terms of their interactions and preferences. It serves as a foundation for identifying potential items that might be of interest to a given user, as detailed in Equation 4.
S(u,v)=Sf(u,v)+Sbid(u,v)+Snb(u,v)+Sitem(u,v)    (4) 
The elements in similarity matrix S(u, v) vary between 0 and 7. The higher the value in the matrix, the greater the similarity between the related users.
3.5.2 Historical data consideration
A user's historical data plays a pivotal role in shaping recommendations. By analyzing past interactions, purchases, and preferences, we can glean insights into a user's tastes and inclinations. This historical context ensures that the recommendations are not only based on current interactions but also influenced by a user's long-term behavior.
3.5.3 Item ranking
Once user similarities are computed and historical data is factored in, the next step is to rank items based on their relevance to a given user. This ranking process involves scoring items based on their potential appeal to the user, considering both the user's behavior and the item's attributes.
3.5.4 Top-K recommendations
The culmination of this recommendation method is the generation of the Top-K recommendations. These are the K items that have the highest relevance scores for a user. By focusing on the top-rated items, we ensure that users are presented with products that are most likely to align with their preferences and needs.
The recommendation for a user u is formulated as Equation 5:
RSu={i1, i2, …, iK}    (5) 
where ik∈I , and K is defined as the mean of historical order number of user u. This formula ensures that the recommended items are those with the highest relevance scores, taking into account both user similarity and item attributes.
In summary, this recommendation method is a multi-faceted approach that synergizes user behaviors, item attributes, and historical data to generate personalized product suggestions. By considering a wide array of factors and employing sophisticated algorithms, we aim to provide users with recommendations that are both relevant and meaningful, enhancing their e-commerce experience.

In this section, a real case dataset was utilized to assess the effectiveness of the proposed recommendation model. The case study results demonstrate the proficient performance of the proposed approach.
4.1 Data descriptions
The research presented in this study heavily relies on the rich dataset sourced from Beijing Huadian E-commerce Technology Limited Company, a leading entity in the B2B E-commerce sector of the electric power industry. This meticulously curated dataset, which spans the entire duration of 2022, offers an unparalleled window into the multifaceted interactions of 217 distinct users as they navigate through an extensive catalog of 346,672 products.
At the heart of this dataset lies five pivotal categories of user behavior: order data, following data, browsing data, bidding data, and non-bidding data. Each of these categories, while valuable in its own right, collectively paints a comprehensive picture of user interactions, preferences, and decision-making processes on the platform. The more traditional data types, such as order, following, and browsing data, provide insights into patterns of product discovery, interest, and acquisition. On the other hand, the inclusion of specialized data types like bidding and non-bidding data offers a deep dive into the unique B2B behaviors that set this platform apart from conventional e-commerce platforms. The intricate relationship between bidding activities and order behaviors, for instance, sheds light on the multi-layered negotiation, evaluation, and decision-making phases that often precede a finalized B2B transactio

Integrated into e-commerce platforms, recommender systems help users navigate vast inventories with tailored recommendations based on their preferences and behavior (Jha et al., 2021). By analyzing user data, these systems improve both user experience and engagement, optimizing recommendation personalization (Zhao, 2023). CF is particularly effective, using insights from multiple users to predict individual preferences based on shared product interactions (Yu et al., 2021). These AI-driven tools give businesses a competitive edge by enhancing user engagement.
Theme 6: Advanced E-commerce Analytics
In the dynamic world of e-commerce, a suite of innovative technologies including big data analytics, data mining, and deep learning is revolutionizing online trading and enhancing customer experiences. At the forefront, big data analytics and data mining are critical for managing large datasets, which help in predicting customer preferences and bolstering decision-making processes (Jeevitha et al., 2023; Mandala et al., 2023). Specifically, data mining technology plays a key role in efficiently extracting vital information from e-commerce platforms, facilitating text retrieval, and analyzing consumption trends to forecast consumer demand and purchasing power (Zhong, 2022). Moreover, deep learning models like “DeepLimeSeg” are enhancing these capabilities further by refining customer segmentation through advanced algorithms, thereby improving the precision and transparency of marketing efforts (Talaat et al., 2023). Collectively, these advanced tools are reshaping e- commerce, facilitating more personalized and efficient interactions that enhance the customer experience.
Theme 7: Customer Support Powered by AI
This theme discusses the strategic utilization of AI-powered chatbots by e-commerce enterprises to elevate customer satisfaction levels, optimize operational processes, and establish a distinctive presence in a fiercely competitive market landscape. Chatbots, functioning as virtual assistants, employ AI and NLP algorithms to engage users, replicate human interactions, and provide efficient responses to inquiries in various industries (Siddig & Hines, 2019). They enhance personalized support, reduce customer service costs through automation, and play a vital role in resolving complaints promptly, leading to increased customer satisfaction (Khan, 2020; Singh et al., 2024). Furthermore, these AI-powered assistants contribute to rebuilding customer trust post-service issues and implementing strategic service recovery measures (Song et al., 2023). In essence, chatbots represent a valuable asset in elevating customer experiences and streamlining service operations in the modern digital era.
These themes collectively demonstrate the transformative impact of AI technologies on various aspects of e-commerce, from personalized recommendations and predictive analytics to enhanced customer service and supply chain optimization. By embracing AI-driven strategies and solutions, e-commerce businesses can stay competitive, drive growth, and deliver superior shopping experiences to customers in today’s digital marketplace.
Future Research Frontiers in AI for the E-commerce Sector
The application of the theory, context, characteristics, and methodology (TCCM) framework is essential for comprehensively exploring the multifaceted impact of AI in e-commerce, especially as this field continuously evolves with new technologies and consumer demands. By structuring the study around the TCCM elements, this approach allows for an organized analysis of AI’s role in transforming online commerce, enhancing both academic insight and practical implications for industry stakeholders (Paul et al., 2023). The field of AI and e-commerce is evolving rapidly, offering innovative ways to enhance consumer experience, personalize interactions, and drive business growth. However, this rapid growth also brings challenges that require critical examination, particularly concerning consumer trust, ethical considerations, and sustainable engagement. This objective (RQ5) seeks to explore future research prospects in AI-driven e-commerce through the TCCM framework, which provides a comprehensive structure

2.3.1 Resource planning strategy and ownership regime
NRM strategies can be classified by the form and interest of the stakeholders:
(a)
State property regime
Power and control of resource usage have been in the possession of the State. Any person can also use the resources, but only with the state’s consent. Some examples are the national forest, national parks and military reserves.
(b)
Private property regime
Any properties owned by an established corporate or individual organization. The owner(s) are responsible for both the advantage and the responsibilities to the resources. The most prominent example is private property.
(c)
Common property regimes
It’s a group’s private ownership. The scale, complexity and structure of the group can differ, e.g., aboriginal community, village neighbor. Public parks, grasslands and water resources are few examples.

Natural Resource Management (NRM) refers to the sustainable utilization of major natural resources, such as land, water, air, minerals, forests, fisheries, and wild flora and fauna. Together, these resources provide the ecosystem services that provide better quality to human life. Natural resources provide fundamental life support, in the form of both consumptive and public-good services. Ecological processes maintain soil productivity, nutrient recycling, the cleansing of air and water, and climatic cycles.
Biological diversity (biodiversity) is the occurrence of different types of ecosystems, different species of organisms with the whole range of their variants and genes adapted to different climates, and environments along with their interactions and processes. Biodiversity encompasses the variety of all life on earth. India is one of the 17 mega-biodiversity countries of the world. Although India has only 2.5% of land area, it has a large pool and diverse pool of plants and microbes which accounts for 7.8% of recorded species in the world. Genetic diversity describes the variation in the number and type of genes as well as chromosomes present in different species. The magnitude of variation in genes of a species increases with increase in size and environmental parameters o


2.3 The Role of Publishing in Sustainability:
Explore how different publishing platforms can be used to promote sustainability and educate the public on environmental issues. ong-term sustainability must be a primary goal for any academic publisher. Without it,
knowledge published in journals, books and other formats risks being damaged or lost. If
one step in a series of research disappears, it casts doubt on subsequent work. Publishers,
as disseminators of verified research, have a responsibility to ensure that published
works remain available for future generations.
2 The aim of this paper is to present the point of view of a commercial open access
publisher with regards to sustainability in the current publishing landscape. We briefly
outline salient points from the history and current state of electronic publishing. The
emphasis is on sustainability, and covers both the development of open access and the
story of MDPI. We then move on to some current projects arising from our focus on
sustainability. Putting sustainability at the heart of publishing activities is an imperative
and in the age of electronic publishing new options are emerging that this goal make it
easier to achieve. There are concrete steps that can be taken by any academic publisher
to ensure the sustainability, preservation, and effective dissemination of knowledge.
3 MDPI sees two primary aspects to sustainability. The first pertains to the preservation of
knowledge. Knowledge creation without sustainability makes little sense. New discoveries
builds on older research, which must be archived and preserved, or what comes after it

The platform further provides a weekly summary of SDG topics and progress that allow researchers to quickly scan through a collection of papers and determine their relevance. Cactus Communications is developing this technology further to support researchers, institutions, publishers and policymakers in recognizing SDG-relevant research.
Springer Nature has also released 17 SDG Content Hubs with the goal of connecting researchers addressing SDG challenges with policymakers and business practitioners. By enhancing the visibility of SDG publishing activities through the content hubs, they aim to connect the key communities needed to drive global progress.
The RELX SDG Resource Center is another example that aims to aid researchers and the public by giving them access to critical content that builds understanding about the SDGs. The resource center hosts multiple initiatives like annual events, podcasts, in-depth reports, SDG News Tracker (by LexisNexis Newsdesk) and key research published by Elsevier, all under one roof.
2.2. New journals on SDG-relevant topics
In recent years, many academic publishers have increasingly focused on issues related to sustainable development, aligning with global priorities of the SDGs. For example, PLOS has expanded their Open Access portfolio to include more focused journals like PLOS Climate and PLOS Global Public Health, which directly address environmental sustainability and global health challenges. Similarly, Springer Nature has launched several specialized journals such as Nature Food, Nature Sustainability, Nature Energy, and Nature Water. These journals aim to foster interdisciplinary research that drives innovation in food security, sustainable resource management, renewable energy, and water conservation, critical areas underpinning the SDGs.
Furthermore, the trend towards open access publishing has been instrumental in democratizing knowledge and fostering inclusivity in scientific discourse. Springer Nature’s Discover series, including Discover Cities, Discover Oceans, Discover Energy, and Discover Sustainability, exemplifies this shift by offering a fully open access (OA) platform for researchers across the globe. By publishing Open Access, these journals are dedicated to reaching a broader audience of policymakers, global scholars, and the public. Additionally, platforms like ScienceOpen have introduced journals such as the Journal of Disability Research published by the King Salman Center for Disability Research, which contributes to SDG goals like reducing inequalities. ScienceOpen also provides publishing solutions for local journals like the Nigerian Journal of Tropical Engineering or the Journal of Ecological Society from Pune, India. These initiatives reflect a growin

2.8   Sustainable Practices in Publishing:
he paradoxical nature of the open access movement has been widely acknowledged. What started as a movement that was to make research open and accessible to all, ensuring equitable participation, might have just contributed to creating more inequalities. The open access publishing models, largely still relying on Article Processing Charges (APCs), have indeed opened access to readers, at the same time closing it for authors unable to pay the ever-rising fees [2]. Several publishers took active steps towards reviewing their business models to create approaches that would deliver on the Open Science promise [3].
At PLOS, we experiment with business models that aim to forge a truly inclusive publishing environment and remove financial barriers to authors and institutions. We do so by listening to the communities and developing models that address specific needs. And we do it through trial and error: launching pilot models like Community Action Publishing (CAP). With it, we tackled the question of selective journals. Selectivity does not have to mean that costs become huge, and it does not need to perpetuate exclusion. To show that selectivity is possible without high APCs and to move beyond a model that is built on ’articles’. This model aims to eliminate author APCs to make our most selective Open Access journals truly open to read

2.9.  Case Studies in Effective Sustainability Communication:
group recognizes the challenges faced by all stakeholders – researchers, funders, institutions, and publishers – in navigating the current OA landscape. They aim to address the perverse incentives and administrative burdens associated with APCs and explore sustainable, inclusive alternatives. The goal is to move towards an equitable OA model that supports diverse research outputs and fosters Open Science practices. This initiative aligns with broader efforts to make OA more inclusive and equitable, reducing reliance on APCs and transformative agreements that benefit only a few large publishers.
The group, which includes librarians, funders, and publishers, aims to develop models that do not rely on APCs, recognizing their unfairness and limitations. Initial discussions revealed that merely identifying equitable models is insufficient, leading to the development of a framework to assess the equity of various business models. Inspired by SPARC’s “How Open is it?”, this “How equitable is it?” framework will use a set of questions to evaluate and benchmark business models based on equity criteria. This approach allows institutions, publishers, and funders to assess and promote equitable participation in research. The framework focuses on criteria such as eliminating financial barriers, ensuring fee transparency, and promoting open research practices. This model-agnostic framework empowers stakeholders to determine the equity of different OA arrangements effectively. The framework, as of June 2024 in its first draft form, after review, shall be released to the community later this year.
3.3. Equity recommended
The Open Access Scholarly Publishing Association (OASPA) presents yet another take on addressing the issue of equity. As they strive to hear all the voices of stakeholders from diverse geographical and economic contexts, they devoted 2023 to workshops and feedback sessions dedicated specifically to the notion of equity in open access publishing. OASPA defines equity in OA as addressing both financial barriers to publishing and ensuring inclusive engagement models, advocating for the removal of author-facing fees to make OA accessible to all researchers. Their research highlighted that publication charges hinder many authors globally, suggesting that current pay-to-publish models only benefit a minority. OASPA aims to shift towards OA by default, where all content is freely accessible without author fees, though acknowledging this requires sustainable financial models. Based on their research they have now formulated a set of recommendations to increase equity in open access. OASPA is currently asking for the community’s feedback on the first draft of this document.
Regardless of what concrete steps the scholarly communications community chooses to take to address the question of equity, it is vital to realize that this is not a one-person job. The success of the SDG blueprint relies on collaborative, cumulative commitment coming from all stakeholders in the scholarly communications sector: researchers, publishers, funders, librarians, policymakers and more. On a global scale, beyond our small academic publishing circle, it relies on global cumulative action, with all on board.
4. Translating research into practice
Charlie Rapple, Co-founder, Kudos (growkudos.com)
Part of the challenge of achieving the SDGs is that they require grassroots change. Sustainability can be encouraged via top-down government interventions, but only mass attitudinal and behavioural change will ‘move the needle’ for a lot of the goals. This means more people need to be aware of the goals, and to be persuaded to take action. This is something that we in the scholarly community are well placed to support. We have an important role to play in filling the knowledge gap, helping people around the world to understand the evidence that has shaped the goals, and the research that underpins recommended actions. This breaks down into three areas: cognitive accessibility, discoverability, and user experience.
4.1. Cognitive accessibility
Traditional scholarly communications, such as research articles, monographs, even textbooks, are not designed for influencing broad audiences. But they do provide the basis for telling persuasive stories around research: adding context (real-world examples of challenges being faced by communities or environments) and fleshing out the potential impact (how things could improve if the research was put into practice). Some examples include:
•
Adding plain language summaries to research publications - explaining what the research is about and why it is important helps more people understand it; plain language summaries are also much more easily translated for speakers of other languages.
•
Communicating research visually - many of those who are affected by the SDGs, or who need to act differently if the SDGs are to be achieved, do not have high levels of literacy. Infographics, videos, and other multimedia interpretations of research findings can help maximize the audience for research.
•
Audience briefings - providing recommendations for different groups, such as policymakers, healthcare practitioners, educators and industry can help expedite change by more clearly setting out wh

3.2  Introduction to Supply Chain Management
An overview of the basic concepts and components of supply chain management, focusing on the flow of goods, information, and finances.
he way in which companies have conducted, managed, controlled and integrated their
business operations have experienced dramatic changes during the last couple of years –
this is especially true in the worldwide recording and music industries. Rapid advances
in technology and increasing regulatory freedom have changed the rules of operation
and competition. Businesses are now competing globally and traditional barriers
between industries are breaking down. To cope with these and other changes and
achieve superior performance, business leaders are moving towards new business
paradigms that allow their companies to work more closely together with their
traditional and new business partners (which include all clients and suppliers up and
down the supply chain), in order to adapt to the rapidly changing marketplace.
As discussed in the fourth chapter under point 4.2, it is proposed by the mentioned
authors that this new collaboration can be successfully achieved by outsourcing all non-
core business activities to a third party business partner, which in turn will lead to an
improved integration through supply chain management. As companies focus on their
core activities and outsource the rest, their success increasingly depends on their ability
to control what happens in the value chain outside their own boundaries (Magretta
2000: 29 - 59). Supply chain leaders are thus reconsidering the linkages, not only
between functions within their own companies, but also with other An Introduction to Supply Chain Management 
This free online course helps you manage your supply chain operations and processes successfully. 
Supply chain management is one of the many new management tactics that have emerged and rapidly developed across different industries worldwide. This course will help you understand supply chain systems, logistics and customer response principles. We explore global supply chain operations, warehouse management and the latest business concepts to help you improve your supply chain processes and boost your business’ productivity.

change and increasingly complex and global supply chains have created huge
challenges for all participants. Traditional channel structures and behaviours in the
industry’s supply chains have not kept pace with these changes. In the markets of the
future, comprehensive management which collaborate the supply chain as a whole is
needed to fulfil the new demands set by players and consumers alike.
The hypothesis statement of this thesis is in part derived from the problem statement.
This hypothesis statement is discussed in the research methodology in Chapter 5 under
point 5.3.3 and is stated as follows:
“Record Companies in the South African Recording Industry should outsource
all their non-core business activities to one strategic business partner.”
It is clear to see how this statement is derived from the problem statement of this thesis,
as described here in point 1.1.1. This statement, as well as the opportunities and
problems it may present, is the core around which this thesis cent

Introduction to software engineering principles and methodologies that are applicable to the development of supply chain management systems.:9
(c) The study design
The design of the research study was drafted in accordance with the prescribed
methodology of a proper research proposal that were explained in point 1.2.1.1
above.
(d) Sampling and data capturing
Sampling and data capturing of all information gathered from research as well as
from interviews with targeted players in the recording industry are utilised.
Employees of record companies, music dealers, compact disc manufacturers and
supply chain management (SCM) companies were contacted and interviewed
through personal interviews, telephone conversations and electronic mails (refer
to the details of the respondents in Chapter 5 under point 5.4.3).
(e) Information evaluation
All researched data were scrutinised and reduced to a manageable quantity,
where after it was used to develop summaries, conclusions and ultimately the
new MODEL C in the last chapter.
(f) Information analysis
The gathered data and information were analysed, assigned with qualitative and
quantitive values and then interpreted

3.5  Supply Chain Digitalization
Exploring the role of digital technologies and software in transforming traditional supply chains into digital networks. The impact of change on logistics systems
Change can either be viewed as a thorny management issue, or as an important
competitive advantage. For logistics practitioners, change comes in many forms, for
example faster order cycle times, increasingly differentiated products and services and
ever more sophisticated technologies to help manage all of this complexity. One
consequence of these changes is the need for more dynamic and responsive logistics
systems that can readily adapt and respond to the changing needs and requirements.
This study will aim to prove that the key to mastering change as a competitive weapon
has two equally important facets: firstly the development of internal company
capabilities and competencies necessary to be truly productive, profitable and flexible,
and secondly to develop linkages and partnerships in the supply chain in order to reap
the optimum benefits of the logistics or supply chain management process.UUnniivvee rrss iittyy ooff PP rree ttoorriiaa ee ttdd –– SS ttee yynn,, MM MM ((22000055))

A logistics system can be termed a competitive advantage only to the extent that it
provides customers with products and services that they want or need, when they want
or need them. Once customer services strategies are identified, marketing and
distribution channels must be designed to perform to the required standards. Analytical
tools can be used to optimally allocate and deploy financial and human resources to
achieve desired levels of service in a logistics network. Preparing the business for
change and doing things differently, may be th

3.8  Security and Privacy in Supply Chain Software:
Addressing the challenges of ensuring data security and privacy in supply chain management software solutions. onnectivity
The more people or businesses work together in a network or in a supply chain,
the higher the value of that network becomes. Internal connectivity as well as
connectivity to the outside world must not be rated as purely sufficient, but must
be seen to offer added value. In order to successfully manage either knowledge,
change, transformation or any other organisational issue, there needs to be
connectivity in the channel. Both connectivity (‘point b’ above) as well as speed
(discussed in ‘point c’ below) are needed to extract value from the above-
mentioned knowledge (in ‘point a’ above).
(c) Speed
Speed to market is vital. Getting the latest music release sold and delivered into
the trade and onto shop shelves before the competition will ensure at least an
initial market dominance. Just as important is speed of communication to
customers and suppliers (i.e. successful marketing as is discussed in Chapters 3
and 6). Most businesses operate in real time and need the correct and relevant
information available at the click of a button. This is one of the main advantagesUUnniivvee rrss iittyy ooff PP rree ttoorriiaa ee ttdd –– SS ttee yynn,, MM MM ((22000055))
3.9  Case Studies and Real-world Applications
Analyzing real-world cases of supply chain management and traceability using software solutions. Reduced risk
Reduced risk accompanied by an increase in certainty of demand can be
achieved. The more information gathered for the forecast (be it from the sales
and marketing team, or via the operations department), the lower the risk of
receiving unprepared-for orders becomes.
(b) Calculation of danger stock levels
By planning ahead and being aware of future orders, a company will be able to
calculate its needed stock levels. A reduction in inventory levels, which in turn
holds significant capital benefits, will be achieved by implementing the
information gained through the forecast.
(c) Production and human resource planning
Fewer staff will be needed to cover demand peaks, for example during the very
busy Christmas holiday shopping season when record companies usually
achieve their highest sales figures (refer to the sales graphs in Annexures C and
D at the end of the thesis). If the forecasting system is accurate, these increased
levels of demand can be anticipated and adequately planned for. The high
amounts of money, which usually needs to be spent on paying over-time
salaries, can then be drastically reduced.
(d) Better demand planning
A definite improvement in the visibility of the customer or the end-user’s
demand can be obtained. By collaborating the research and experience of all
divisions (operations, sales and marketing), a better idea can be formed of what
the needs of customers will be like in the future. This will lead to better planning
through the use of an improved forecasting system.
(e) Improved customer service
Improved customer service will be a direct result

The Future Of Science and Engineering 
The future of science and engineering careers is bright. With the advent of new technologies, there are now many new opportunities.
By following these tips, you can ensure that your career path is a long one:
Keep up with all of the newest developments in your field. If you aren’t aware of changes in your area, you’ll be left behind by those who are. For example, if you’re a software developer, make sure you’re familiar with the latest programming languages and frameworks trends.
Don’t be afraid to try something new. It’s not always easy to learn a new skill or take on a new role. But by doing so, you’ll be able to expand your horizons and gain an edge over your competition.
Stay current with the latest tools and techniques. In today’s world, it’s more important than ever to stay ahead of the curve. If you don’t know what’s happening in your industry, you’ll be at a competitive disadvantage.
The Constantly Changing Education Landscape
As people start to emerge from the devastation of COVID-19, everyone is asking the same question: What should education look like in a post-pandemic world?
The truth is that many aspects of the education system — from where and how we learn to what we study — need to be transformed if we want an education system that is relevant to our current world.
Here are four significant areas in which our education system needs to change:
Students expect to have the ability to learn from anywhere. This is probably one of the most obvious changes brought about by recent events: students now expect to be able to pursue their studies from any location. This versatility is vital for those students who cannot physically attend classes due to health and safety concerns or because they live in remote locations.
Student mobility is also an essential factor here. Students want the opportunity to study abroad, but they don’t necessarily want or need to move overseas permanently. Remote learning options make it easier for students to move around while studying without disrupting their academic progress.
Students expect active learning rather than lectures. Students are looking for different learning experiences, such as more active, hands-on learning rather than traditional lectures.
Our world is constantly changing, and the taught skills must change with it. To create a more equitable, just, and sustainable world, we need to get better at teaching science and engineering. Science education has the power to transform lives, improve health and livelihoods, increase wealth and drive economic growth. It can also help close the gender gap in STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, math).
If we want to change the world of science and engineering for the better, we need to find ways of supporting people who have been excluded from these fields in the past. We must do this by providing equal opportunities for everyone regardless of their race or gender identity. This change means creating spaces where people can engage with science without feeling like outsiders or imposters. We also need more women leaders who will serve as role models for young girls interested in pursuing careers related to STEM subjects.
Academic Freedom to Discover Your Purpose
Open Curriculum Design at Atlantic International University
The Master of Engineering Systems program is offered online via distance learning. After evaluating both academic record and life experience, AIU staff working in conjunction with Faculty and Academic Advisors will assist students in setting up a custom-made program, designed on an individual basis. This flexibility to meet student needs is seldom found in other distance learning programs. Our online program does not require all students to take the same subjects/courses, use the same books, or learning materials. Instead, the online Master of Engineering Systems curriculum is designed individually by the student and academic advisor.
It specifically addresses strengths and weaknesses with respect to market opportunities in the student’s major and intended field of work.

1.10nline Retail and E-commerce in the Renewable Energy Sector
This course explores the intersection of online retail and e-commerce with renewable energy. Students will gain expertise in leveraging digital platforms to promote and sell renewable energy solutions, products, and services. The course covers market trends, customer behavior, e-commerce strategies, and sustainability practices.
1.2 Introduction to E-commerce in the Renewable Energy Sector
An overview of the e-commerce landscape specifically tailored for renewable energy products, services, and solutions.
In 2025, the commerce landscape will be more interwoven with sustainability than ever before. Based on the content extracted from the provided article, here is a Key Takeaways section: any firms are innovating in the ways in which they sell products online. Firms can make use of a range of digital technologies, including artificial intelligence, blockchain, the Internet of Things and autonomous delivery devices like drones or robots to facilitate e-commerce, while new payment services like mobile money and digital wallets widen the scope of e-commerce.
Online platforms match buyers and sellers, including across borders, to facilitate online transactions. Online platforms enable more and different products to be sold, but often require mechanisms that match buyers and sellers, boost trust among unknown e-commerce participants, and encourage more firms to enter the marketplace. Also growing are subscription service business models (e.g. music streaming). Such models enable the continuous provision of products in exchange for recurring payments. Consumers may find such models convenient, particularly for goods that require replenishment, while firms may benefit from lower marginal costs, reduced frictions and longer-term revenue streams. A third business model includes those that use offline or physical features to sell online (e.g. omni-channel models). From automated supermarkets to skip-the-queue mobile application ordering, more firms are experimenting with mechanisms that enable e-commerce while removing the frictions associated with offline ordering.
1.3 Understanding the Renewable Energy Market
Insights into the renewable energy market, including key players, trends, and consumer
Targeted, flexible and co-ordinated policies can unlock the potential of e-commerce 
The rise of the Internet in the 1990s fuelled the growth of e-commerce and put it on the agenda of policy makers worldwide. But the rapid pace at which digital transformation has progressed and the dynamism of e-commerce markets requires a fresh look at policy frameworks to ensure that they support further e-commerce innovations. In particular, three policy considerations should be taken into account.
1.4. E-commerce Strategies for Renewable Energy Products
Effective e-commerce strategies tailored for marketing and selling renewable energy products online.
E-commerce must be better measured and e-commerce policy more co-ordinated to unlock the potential of e-commerce for all 
Technological change is altering the e-commerce landscape, and these new developments affect policy frameworks along several dimensions. Some of the challenges identified in the early days of e-commerce remain relevant (e.g. related to data protection), but new challenges have also emerged (e.g. the rise of tradeable services and their implications for trade policy). These developments require a holistic approach to e-commerce policy making, including co-operation and collaboration across policy areas. In particular, consumer protection, taxation, competition, trade and environmental policies should be co-ordinated, including at the highest levels of government and at the global level, to ensure that trade-offs are carefully considered and to guard against unintended consequences of misaligned policy action. Many such rules are local, which further underscores the need for a consistent and co-ordinated whole-of-government approach to e-commerce policy making at all levels of government.
At the same time, a lack of e-commerce data limits the ability of policy makers to determine the need for policy action and calls for more focus on the e-commerce measurement agenda. On the one hand, the harmonisation of available data on e-commerce across countries (e.g. ICT usage surveys) should continue and adjust in response to an evolving technological environment. Changing technologies and business models might eventually also warrant a reconsideration of the current OECD e-commerce definition. At the same time, the limitations of ICT usage surveys requires governments to foster the inclusion of e-commerce related questions in other official data sources, such as structural business or household expenditure surveys, as well as the use of non-standard data sources.
Targeted policies can address e-commerce divides 
Those who do not or cannot engage in e-commerce may find themselves on the wrong side of a potentially persistent and harmful digital divide as digital transformation progresses. SMEs lag behind larger firms in terms of e-commerce participation, but policy can help by addressing bottlenecks that might result in high costs associated with delivery and returns. Reducing regulatory uncertainty and fostering an inclusive business environment can help small firms trade online and across borders, as well as integrate successfully with larger service providers, such as online platforms.
E-commerce gaps for individuals remain significant along a range of dimensions, including education, income, age and gender, as well as for those living in rural areas. Factors that reduce participation of these groups are often related to economic and social conditions that reach far beyond e-commerce, including rural-urban divides, income distribution, unequal access to education and an aging society. With regard to e-commerce, these conditions may manifest themselves in low connectivity, a lack of digital skills, low levels of trust or a lack of viable payment options, all factors that can be addressed by policy action
1.4 Consumer Behavior in Online Retail
Analyzing consumer behavior and preferences in the context of online retail for renewable energy products.
3.1 Electric power B2B descriptions
The Business-to-Business (B2B) framework within the electric power industry stands as a unique and complex entity, markedly different from the more familiar terrain of consumer focused markets. This distinction is not merely in scale but also in the depth and intricacies of its operations. Predominantly characterized by transactions of substantial magnitude, the electric power B2B sector encompasses a vast array of activities. These range from the procurement of heavy duty equipment in bulk quantities to the formulation and execution of comprehensive contracts that oversee power generation, transmission, and distribution across vast geographical expanses.
The sheer scale and complexity of these transactions give rise to extended sales cycles. Unlike the swift decision-making often seen in B2C scenarios, B2B dealings in the electric power industry are methodical and deliberate. Each transaction, be it a purchase order for machinery or a long-term service contract, undergoes a meticulous process of evaluations. These assessments are not just about cost-effectiveness but also delve into the technical compatibility, long-term viability, and potential scalability of the offerings. Negotiations, often spanning multiple rounds, aim to strike a balance between commercial interests and operational feasibility. Furthermore, the approval processes are multi-tiered, involving various stakeholders from technical experts and financial analysts to top-tier management, ensuring that every decision aligns with the organization's strategic objectives.
In this industry, the products and services on offer are not generic; they are highly specialized solutions crafted to address specific challenges. Whether it's a state-of-the-art transformer, an advanced grid management system, or consultancy services for renewable energy integration, each product or service demands a deep-seated understanding. Stakeholders must grasp not only the technical specifications but also the broader implications of their choices. This includes potential integration challenges with existing systems, adherence to ever-evolving regulatory frameworks, and ensuring compliance with both local and international safety and environmental standards. In essence, every B2B transaction in the electric power sector is a testament to the industry's multifaceted nature, where commercial, technical, and regulatory considerations converge.
3.2 Notations
In this section, we introduce and define the notations that will be used throughout the methodology. This notation serves as the foundation for understanding the data structures, user behaviors, and item attributes, as well as the collaborative filtering approach we use to recommend products to users.
U: Represents the set of all users in the system. Each user is uniquely identified by an index in this set, N represents the number of the users.
I: Denotes the set of all items available in the system. Similar to users, each item is uniquely identified by an index in this set, M represents the total number of the items.
n: Represents the number of categories for individual product attributes.
m: Represents the number of categories for user behaviors.
S (u, v): Represents the similarity between users u and v. This similarity metric is crucial for collaborative filtering, as it determines how similar two users are in terms of their preferences. The basic formula for collaborative filtering is given by Equation 1:
rui=∑v∈US(u,v)rvi    (1) 
Oui, Aui, Bui: these notations denote the order, following, and browsing numbers respectively for user u and item i. They capture different types of implicit feedback from users.
wo, wa, wb: these are the weight ratios associated with order, following, and browsing data respectively. They determine the significance or influence of each type of implicit feedback in the recommendation process. For examples, we can set wo = 1, wa = 0.5, wb = 0.5.
BIu, NBIu: these vectors are behavior numbers varying time, representing the bidding and non-bidding behaviors of user u respectively. They capture unique B2B behaviors that are essential for understanding user preferences in the electric power E-commerce domain.
The foundation of this collaborative filtering approach is based on the principle that users who have behaved similarly in the past will continue to have similar preferences in the future. The notations introduced above will be instrumental in formulating and understanding the mathematical models and algorithms we employ in subsequent sections.
1.5 Digital Marketing for Renewable Energy E-commerce
Best practices for digital marketing in promoting renewable energy products and services online Public policies can support the creation of innovative e-commerce business models 
As digital transformation progresses, new business models will arise in ways that are difficult to predict, but which also challenge traditional policy frameworks. In particular, some regulatory barriers preserve artificial distinctions between online and offline commerce, even as firms increasingly pursue business models that combine both elements. Where local zoning laws prevent multi-purpose use of brick-and-mortar stores, or planning regulations prevent the development of new last-mile logistic solutions, the potential of e-commerce diminishes.
Regulatory approaches to new e-commerce business models should focus on remaining experimental, transparent and flexible. Experimental regulatory waivers have been successfully used to test new technologies like drones and digital payment mechanisms; future applications for e-commerce could include cryptocurrencies and 3D printing. Existing rules could be made clearer to reduce uncertainty for innovative firms. Policy makers should avoid attempting to regulate particular business models. Instead, they should ensure that particular business functions conform with regulatory frameworks, while better accounting for the interlinkages across business functions.
1.6. Sustainable Practices in E-commerce
driven solutions are revolutionizing retail operations by optimizing supply chain management and e-commerce processes. Ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithms play a crucial role in improving vehicle routing, enhancing delivery speed, reducing costs, and minimizing resource use (Revanna & Al-Nakash, 2023; Ushada et al., 2022). In e-commerce, AI scrutinizes user behavior to track browsing patterns, cart additions, and purchase completions. Neural networks like WaveNet refine sales forecasting by analyzing product descriptions, enabling businesses to predict demand and better manage inventory and marketing (Chen et al., 2024). Moreover, deep learning models process clinical and genetic data for improved medical diagnostics, such as early cancer detection (Kumar et al., 2023). Together, these AI technologies create an efficient, adaptive business ecosystem.
Theme 4: AI-Enhanced Shopping Experience
AI is transforming e-commerce by boosting operational efficiency and customer engagement through personalized shopping experiences (Birau et al., 2023; Subbaiah et al., 2024). Machine learning enhances this by accurately predicting customer churn, enabling effective retention strategies (Lee et al., 2024). AI also automates inventory management, reduces costs, and enhances data security (Birau et al., 2023). AI-driven chatbots improve customer service and facilitate cross-border transactions (Meltzer, 2023). By analyzing social media feedback, AI provides actionable insights that help businesses refine strategies and products (Alotaibi, 2023). These tools reshape consumer behavior, making shopping more personalized and increasing retention and sales for e-commerce.

Implementing sustainable business practices within the e-commerce model for renewable energy.
1.7 Case Studies in Renewable Energy E-commerce:
3.3 Fusion of behavioral data
The fusion of behavioral data is a pivotal step in the methodology, aiming to create a comprehensive representation of user interactions on the platform. This section delves into the intricacies of how different types of behavioral data are combined to provide a holistic view of user preferences and activities.
3.3.1 Order, following, and browsing data
These three types of data capture the most direct interactions of users with items on the platform. Order data (Oui) represents confirmed transactions, following data (Aui) signifies items that users have shown interest in, and browsing data (Bui) captures the items that users have viewed or explored.
3.3.2 Weight ratios
The weight ratios wo, wa, andwb are crucial in determining the significance of each type of interaction. They allow us to assign varying importance to different behaviors, reflecting the relative impact of each interaction type on user preferences. For instance, a confirmed order might carry more weight than merely browsing an item.
3.3.3 Bidding and non-bidding data
Unique to the B2B E-commerce landscape, bidding (BIu) and non-bidding (NBIu) data provide insights into the negotiation and decision-making processes of users. These behaviors, while not directly linked to transactions, offer valuable context about user intentions and preferences.
3.3.4 Behavior vectors
The behavior vectors for bidding and non-bidding data are formulated to capture the essence of these unique interactions. By characterizing user similarity through these vectors, we can better understand the relationships and similarities between users based on their bidding and non-bidding behaviors.
The fusion formula for order, following, and browsing data is given by Equation 2:
Fui = woOui + waAui + wbBui    (2) 
This formula ensures that each type of interaction contributes proportionally to the final fused representation based on its assigned weight. A cosine similarity measure is used here to characterize user similarity for the fusion of behaviors, as detailed in Equation 3.
Sf(u,v)=cos(θ)=Fu·Fv||Fu||||Fv||    (3) 
For bidding and non-bidding data, we employ a cosine similarity measure to characterize user similarity Sbid(u, v), Snb(u, v). This metric captures the angle between the behavior vectors, providing a measure of how alike two users are in terms of their bidding and non-bidding behaviors:
The fusion of behavioral data is a multi-faceted process that combines various types of user interactions to create a unified representation. This representation serves as the foundation for subsequent recommendation processes, ensuring that all relevant user behaviors are considered.
3.4 Fusion of item attribute information
The integration of item attribute information is a cornerstone in the methodology, ensuring that the attributes and characteristics of items are adequately represented and factored into the recommendation process. This section elucidates the methods and rationale behind the fusion of various item related data, highlighting the importance of capturing the multifaceted nature of products in the B2B E-commerce domain.
3.4.1 Item attribute vector
Central to the approach is the concept of item attributes. This vector encapsulates various attributes of an item, such as its category, suppliers and other relevant metadata. For each item and each item attribute (e.g. category), we construct a one-hot-vector based on different values of attributes. Hence, the size of item attribute vector IA related to individual item attribute is M × n.
3.4.2 User behavior matrix
With the item attribute vectors in place, we can then construct the user-attribute behavior matrix. Firstly, the overall user behavior vector Bm×M is established with each element representing the number of specific behavior (e.g., order number) for each item. The m is the number of behavior types and M is the number of items. Secondly, through matrix operations Bm×MIAM×n, we can obtain the user specific-attribute interaction matrix Rm×n. Finally, by summing up each column of the matrix, we can obtain a vector representing the behavioral performance of each user for each attribute. Therefore, the user-attribute behavior matrix MN×n is established. Mapping user behaviors onto the item attribute vectors, we can capture the nuanced interactions between users and the multifaceted attributes of items.
3.4.3 Similarity computation
The fusion of item attribute information and user behavior culminates in the computation of similarity scores. The item-attribute similarity Sitem(u, v) extracted from MN×n, measure the likeness between two users based on their item attribute information (e.g. item category, suppliers) and the aggregated user interactions (e.g., order, following, browsing). The similarity scores play a pivotal role in the recommendation process, guiding the system toward items that are contextually and attribute wise similar to the user's preferences.
To compute the similarity between users based on their item attribute vectors and user interactions, we employ the cosine similarity metric. In this paper, Sitem(u, v) is composed of four parts, mainly the three category (primary, secondary and tertiary item category) similarities Sitemcategory(u, v) and one supplier similarity Sitemsupplier(u, v).
In essence, the fusion of item information is a meticulous process that aims to bridge the gap between raw item attributes and structured data representations. By integrating item characteristics with user behaviors, we ensure that the recommendation system is both context-aware and attribute-sensitive, leading to more accurate and meaningful recommendations.
3.5 Fusion of behavioral data and item information
The recommendation method forms the crux of the approach, leveraging the fused behavioral data and item information to generate personalized product suggestions for users. This section delves into the intricacies of the recommendation algorithm, elucidating the steps and logic that drive the generation of tailored recommendations.
3.5.1 User similarity computation
At the heart of the recommendation method is the computation of user similarity. By comparing the behavior profiles of different users, we can identify patterns and preferences that are shared among them. This similarity metric, denoted as S(u, v), provides a measure of how alike two users are in terms of their interactions and preferences. It serves as a foundation for identifying potential items that might be of interest to a given user, as detailed in Equation 4.
S(u,v)=Sf(u,v)+Sbid(u,v)+Snb(u,v)+Sitem(u,v)    (4) 
The elements in similarity matrix S(u, v) vary between 0 and 7. The higher the value in the matrix, the greater the similarity between the related users.
3.5.2 Historical data consideration
A user's historical data plays a pivotal role in shaping recommendations. By analyzing past interactions, purchases, and preferences, we can glean insights into a user's tastes and inclinations. This historical context ensures that the recommendations are not only based on current interactions but also influenced by a user's long-term behavior.
3.5.3 Item ranking
Once user similarities are computed and historical data is factored in, the next step is to rank items based on their relevance to a given user. This ranking process involves scoring items based on their potential appeal to the user, considering both the user's behavior and the item's attributes.
3.5.4 Top-K recommendations
The culmination of this recommendation method is the generation of the Top-K recommendations. These are the K items that have the highest relevance scores for a user. By focusing on the top-rated items, we ensure that users are presented with products that are most likely to align with their preferences and needs.
The recommendation for a user u is formulated as Equation 5:
RSu={i1, i2, …, iK}    (5) 
where ik∈I , and K is defined as the mean of historical order number of user u. This formula ensures that the recommended items are those with the highest relevance scores, taking into account both user similarity and item attributes.
In summary, this recommendation method is a multi-faceted approach that synergizes user behaviors, item attributes, and historical data to generate personalized product suggestions. By considering a wide array of factors and employing sophisticated algorithms, we aim to provide users with recommendations that are both relevant and meaningful, enhancing their e-commerce experience.

1.8  Regulatory Environment for Online Retail in Renewable Energy:
Experiments and discussion
In this section, a real case dataset was utilized to assess the effectiveness of the proposed recommendation model. The case study results demonstrate the proficient performance of the proposed approach.
4.1 Data descriptions
The research presented in this study heavily relies on the rich dataset sourced from Beijing Huadian E-commerce Technology Limited Company, a leading entity in the B2B E-commerce sector of the electric power industry. This meticulously curated dataset, which spans the entire duration of 2022, offers an unparalleled window into the multifaceted interactions of 217 distinct users as they navigate through an extensive catalog of 346,672 products.
At the heart of this dataset lies five pivotal categories of user behavior: order data, following data, browsing data, bidding data, and non-bidding data. Each of these categories, while valuable in its own right, collectively paints a comprehensive picture of user interactions, preferences, and decision-making processes on the platform. The more traditional data types, such as order, following, and browsing data, provide insights into patterns of product discovery, interest, and acquisition. On the other hand, the inclusion of specialized data types like bidding and non-bidding data offers a deep dive into the unique B2B behaviors that set this platform apart from conventional e-commerce platforms. The intricate relationship between bidding activities and order behaviors, for instance, sheds light on the multi-layered negotiation, evaluation, and decision-making phases that often precede a finalized B2B transactio

At the forefront, big data analytics and data mining are critical for managing large datasets, which help in predicting customer preferences and bolstering decision-making processes (Jeevitha et al., 2023; Mandala et al., 2023). Specifically, data mining technology plays a key role in efficiently extracting vital information from e-commerce platforms, facilitating text retrieval, and analyzing consumption trends to forecast consumer demand and purchasing power (Zhong, 2022). Moreover, deep learning models like “DeepLimeSeg” are enhancing these capabilities further by refining customer segmentation through advanced algorithms, thereby improving the precision and transparency of marketing efforts (Talaat et al., 2023). Collectively, these advanced tools are reshaping e- commerce, facilitating more personalized and efficient interactions that enhance the customer experience.
Theme 7: Customer Support Powered by AI
This theme discusses the strategic utilization of AI-powered chatbots by e-commerce enterprises to elevate customer satisfaction levels, optimize operational processes, and establish a distinctive presence in a fiercely competitive market landscape. Chatbots, functioning as virtual assistants, employ AI and NLP algorithms to engage users, replicate human interactions, and provide efficient responses to inquiries in various industries (Siddig & Hines, 2019). They enhance personalized support, reduce customer service costs through automation, and play a vital role in resolving complaints promptly, leading to increased customer satisfaction (Khan, 2020; Singh et al., 2024). Furthermore, these AI-powered assistants contribute to rebuilding customer trust post-service issues and implementing strategic service recovery measures (Song et al., 2023). In essence, chatbots represent a valuable asset in elevating customer experiences and streamlining service operations in the modern digital era.
These themes collectively demonstrate the transformative impact of AI technologies on various aspects of e-commerce, from personalized recommendations and predictive analytics to enhanced customer service and supply chain optimization. By embracing AI-driven strategies and solutions, e-commerce businesses can stay competitive, drive growth, and deliver superior shopping experiences to customers in today’s digital marketplace.
Future Research Frontiers in AI for the E-commerce Sector
The application of the theory, context, characteristics, and methodology (TCCM) framework is essential for comprehensively exploring the multifaceted impact of AI in e-commerce, especially as this field continuously evolves with new technologies and consumer demands. By structuring the study around the TCCM elements, this approach allows for an organized analysis of AI’s role in transforming online commerce, enhancing both academic insight and practical implications for industry stakeholders (Paul et al., 2023). The field of AI and e-commerce is evolving rapidly, offering innovative ways to enhance consumer experience, personalize interactions, and drive business growth. However, this rapid growth also brings challenges that require critical examination, particularly concerning consumer trust, ethical considerations, and sustainable engagement. This objective (RQ5) seeks to explore future research prospects in AI-driven e-commerce through the TCCM framework, which provides a comprehensive structure

as disseminators of verified research, have a responsibility to ensure that published
works remain available for future generations.
2 The aim of this paper is to present the point of view of a commercial open access
publisher with regards to sustainability in the current publishing landscape. We briefly
outline salient points from the history and current state of electronic publishing. The
emphasis is on sustainability, and covers both the development of open access and the
story of MDPI. We then move on to some current projects arising from our focus on
sustainability. Putting sustainability at the heart of publishing activities is an imperative
and in the age of electronic publishing new options are emerging that this goal make it
easier to achieve. There are concrete steps that can be taken by any academic publisher
to ensure the sustainability, preservation, and effective dissemination of knowledge.
3 MDPI sees two primary aspects to sustainability. The first pertains to the preservation of
knowledge. Knowledge creation without sustainability makes little sense. New discoveries
builds on older research, which must be archived and preserved, or what comes after it
does not have a firm foundation. The second strand is MDPI’s view that open propagation
of knowledge will enhance mankind’s future and preserve our environment. The founder
of MDPI, Shu Kun Lin, built the company in the belief that advances in research are a key
contributor to solving many of the most pressing needs of our age, including over-use of
the world’s resources and the threat of climate change. The implementatio

2.7  Policy Advocacy and Public Engagement: xploration. The platform further provides a weekly summary of SDG topics and progress that allow researchers to quickly scan through a collection of papers and determine their relevance. Cactus Communications is developing this technology further to support researchers, institutions, publishers and policymakers in recognizing SDG-relevant research.
Springer Nature has also released 17 SDG Content Hubs with the goal of connecting researchers addressing SDG challenges with policymakers and business practitioners. By enhancing the visibility of SDG publishing activities through the content hubs, they aim to connect the key communities needed to drive global progress.
The RELX SDG Resource Center is another example that aims to aid researchers and the public by giving them access to critical content that builds understanding about the SDGs. The resource center hosts multiple initiatives like annual events, podcasts, in-depth reports, SDG News Tracker (by LexisNexis Newsdesk) and key research published by Elsevier, all under one roof.
2.2. New journals on SDG-relevant topics
In recent years, many academic publishers have increasingly focused on issues related to sustainable development, aligning with global priorities of the SDGs. For example, PLOS has expanded their Open Access portfolio to include more focused journals like PLOS Climate and PLOS Global Public Health, which directly address environmental sustainability and global health challenges. Similarly, Springer Nature has launched several specialized journals such as Nature Food, Nature Sustainability, Nature Energy, and Nature Water. These journals aim to foster interdisciplinary research that drives innovation in food security, sustainable resource management, renewable energy, and water conservation, critical areas underpinning the SDGs.
Furthermore, the trend towards open access publishing has been instrumental in democratizing knowledge and fostering inclusivity in scientific discourse. Springer Nature’s Discover series, including Discover Cities, Discover Oceans, Discover Energy, and Discover Sustainability, exemplifies this shift by offering a fully open access (OA) platform for researchers across the globe. By publishing Open Access, these journals are dedicated to reaching a broader audience of policymakers, global scholars, and the public. Additionally, platforms like ScienceOpen have introduced journals such as the Journal of Disability Research published by the King Salman Center for Disability Research, which contributes to SDG goals like reducing inequalities. ScienceOpen also provides publishing solutions for local journals like the Nigerian Journal of Tropical Engineering or the Journal of Ecological Society from Pune, India. These initiatives reflect a growin

2.8   Sustainable Practices in Publishing:
he paradoxical nature of the open access movement has been widely acknowledged. What started as a movement that was to make research open and accessible to all, ensuring equitable participation, might have just contributed to creating more inequalities. The open access publishing models, largely still relying on Article Processing Charges (APCs), have indeed opened access to readers, at the same time closing it for authors unable to pay the ever-rising fees [2]. Several publishers took active steps towards reviewing their business models to create approaches that would deliver on the Open Science promise [3].
At PLOS, we experiment with business models that aim to forge a truly inclusive publishing environment and remove financial barriers to authors and institutions. We do so by listening to the communities and developing models that address specific needs. And we do it through trial and error: launching pilot models like Community Action Publishing (CAP). With it, we tackled the question of selective journals. Selectivity does not have to mean that costs become huge, and it does not need to perpetuate exclusion. To show that selectivity is possible without high APCs and to move beyond a model that is built on ’articles’. This model aims to eliminate author APCs to make our most selective Open Access journals truly open to read

2.9.  Case Studies in Effective Sustainability Communication:
group recognizes the challenges faced by all stakeholders – researchers, funders, institutions, and publishers – in navigating the current OA landscape. They aim to address the perverse incentives and administrative burdens associated with APCs and explore sustainable, inclusive alternatives. The goal is to move towards an equitable OA model that supports diverse research outputs and fosters Open Science practices. This initiative aligns with broader efforts to make OA more inclusive and equitable, reducing reliance on APCs and transformative agreements that benefit only a few large publishers.
The group, which includes librarians, funders, and publishers, aims to develop models that do not rely on APCs, recognizing their unfairness and limitations. Initial discussions revealed that merely identifying equitable models is insufficient, leading to the development of a framework to assess the equity of various business models. Inspired by SPARC’s “How Open is it?”, this “How equitable is it?” framework will use a set of questions to evaluate and benchmark business models based on equity criteria. This approach allows institutions, publishers, and funders to assess and promote equitable participation in research. The framework focuses on criteria such as eliminating financial barriers, ensuring fee transparency, and promoting open research practices. This model-agnostic framework empowers stakeholders to determine the equity of different OA arrangements effectively. The framework, as of June 2024 in its first draft form, after review, shall be released to the community later this year.
3.3. Equity recommended
The Open Access Scholarly Publishing Association (OASPA) presents yet another take on addressing the issue of equity. As they strive to hear all the voices of stakeholders from diverse geographical and economic contexts, they devoted 2023 to workshops and feedback sessions dedicated specifically to the notion of equity in open access publishing. OASPA defines equity in OA as addressing both financial barriers to publishing and ensuring inclusive engagement models, advocating for the removal of author-facing fees to make OA accessible to all researchers. Their research highlighted that publication charges hinder many authors globally, suggesting that current pay-to-publish models only benefit a minority. OASPA aims to shift towards OA by default, where all content is freely accessible without author fees, though acknowledging this requires sustainable financial models. Based on their research they have now formulated a set of recommendations to increase equity in open access. OASPA is currently asking for the community’s feedback on the first draft of this document.
Regardless of what concrete steps the scholarly communications community chooses to take to address the question of equity, it is vital to realize that this is not a one-person job. The success of the SDG blueprint relies on collaborative, cumulative commitment coming from all stakeholders in the scholarly communications sector: researchers, publishers, funders, librarians, policymakers and more. On a global scale, beyond our small academic publishing circle, it relies on global cumulative action, with all on board.
4. Translating research into practice
Charlie Rapple, Co-founder, Kudos (growkudos.com)
Part of the challenge of achieving the SDGs is that they require grassroots change. Sustainability can be encouraged via top-down government interventions, but only mass attitudinal and behavioural change will ‘move the needle’ for a lot of the goals. This means more people need to be aware of the goals, and to be persuaded to take action. This is something that we in the scholarly community are well placed to support. We have an important role to play in filling the knowledge gap, helping people around the world to understand the evidence that has shaped the goals, and the research that underpins recommended actions. This breaks down into three areas: cognitive accessibility, discoverability, and user experience.
4.1. Cognitive accessibility
Traditional scholarly communications, such as research articles, monographs, even textbooks, are not designed for influencing broad audiences. But they do provide the basis for telling persuasive stories around research: adding context (real-world examples of challenges being faced by communities or environments) and fleshing out the potential impact (how things could improve if the research was put into practice). Some examples include:
•
Adding plain language summaries to research publications - explaining what the research is about and why it is important helps more people understand it; plain language summaries are also much more easily translated for speakers of other languages.
•
Communicating research visually - many of those who are affected by the SDGs, or who need to act differently if the SDGs are to be achieved, do not have high levels of literacy. Infographics, videos, and other multimedia interpretations of research findings can help maximize the audience for research.
•
Audience briefings - providing recommendations for different groups, such as policymakers, healthcare practitioners, educators and industry can help expedite change by more clearly setting out wh

3.2  Introduction to Supply Chain Management
An overview of the basic concepts and components of supply chain management, focusing on the flow of goods, information, and finances.
he way in which companies have conducted, managed, controlled and integrated their
business operations have experienced dramatic changes during the last couple of years –
this is especially true in the worldwide recording and music industries. Rapid advances
in technology and increasing regulatory freedom have changed the rules of operation
and competition. Businesses are now competing globally and traditional barriers
between industries are breaking down. To cope with these and other changes and
achieve superior performance, business leaders are moving towards new business
paradigms that allow their companies to work more closely together with their
traditional and new business partners (which include all clients and suppliers up and
down the supply chain), in order to adapt to the rapidly changing marketplace.
As discussed in the fourth chapter under point 4.2, it is proposed by the mentioned
authors that this new collaboration can be successfully achieved by outsourcing all non-
core business activities to a third party business partner, which in turn will lead to an
improved integration through supply chain management. As companies focus on their
core activities and outsource the rest, their success increasingly depends on their ability
to control what happens in the value chain outside their own boundaries (Magretta
2000: 29 - 59). Supply chain leaders are thus reconsidering the linkages, not only
between functions within their own companies, but also with other An Introduction to Supply Chain Management

change and increasingly complex and global supply chains have created huge
challenges for all participants. Traditional channel structures and behaviours in the
industry’s supply chains have not kept pace with these changes. In the markets of the
future, comprehensive management which collaborate the supply chain as a whole is
needed to fulfil the new demands set by players and consumers alike.
The hypothesis statement of this thesis is in part derived from the problem statement.
This hypothesis statement is discussed in the research methodology in Chapter 5 under
point 5.3.3 and is stated as follows:
“Record Companies in the South African Recording Industry should outsource
all their non-core business activities to one strategic business partner.”
It is clear to see how this statement is derived from the problem statement of this thesis,
as described here in point 1.1.1. This statement, as well as the opportunities and
problems it may present, is the core around which this thesis cent

3.5  Supply Chain Digitalization
Exploring the role of digital technologies and software in transforming traditional supply chains into digital networks. The impact of change on logistics systems
Change can either be viewed as a thorny management issue, or as an important
competitive advantage. For logistics practitioners, change comes in many forms, for
example faster order cycle times, increasingly differentiated products and services and
ever more sophisticated technologies to help manage all of this complexity. One
consequence of these changes is the need for more dynamic and responsive logistics
systems that can readily adapt and respond to the changing needs and requirements.
This study will aim to prove that the key to mastering change as a competitive weapon
has two equally important facets: firstly the development of internal company
capabilities and competencies necessary to be truly productive, profitable and flexible,
and secondly to develop linkages and partnerships in the supply chain in order to reap
the optimum benefits of the logistics or supply chain management process.UUnniivvee rrss iittyy ooff PP rree ttoorriiaa ee ttdd –– SS ttee yynn,, MM MM ((22000055))

A logistics system can be termed a competitive advantage only to the extent that it
provides customers with products and services that they want or need, when they want
or need them. Once customer services strategies are identified, marketing and
distribution channels must be designed to perform to the required standards. Analytical
tools can be used to optimally allocate and deploy financial and human resources to
achieve desired levels of service in a logistics network. Preparing the business for
change and doing things differently, may be th

Addressing the challenges of ensuring data security and privacy in supply chain management software solutions. onnectivity
The more people or businesses work together in a network or in a supply chain,
the higher the value of that network becomes. Internal connectivity as well as
connectivity to the outside world must not be rated as purely sufficient, but must
be seen to offer added value. In order to successfully manage either knowledge,
change, transformation or any other organisational issue, there needs to be
connectivity in the channel. Both connectivity (‘point b’ above) as well as speed
(discussed in ‘point c’ below) are needed to extract value from the above-
mentioned knowledge (in ‘point a’ above).
(c) Speed
Speed to market is vital. Getting the latest music release sold and delivered into
the trade and onto shop shelves before the competition will ensure at least an
initial market dominance. Just as important is speed of communication to
customers and suppliers (i.e. successful marketing as is discussed in Chapters 3
and 6). Most businesses operate in real time and need the correct and relevant
information available at the click of a button. This is one of the main advantagesUUnniivvee rrss iittyy ooff PP rree ttoorriiaa ee ttdd –– SS ttee yynn,, MM MM ((22000055))
3.9  Case Studies and Real-world Applications
Analyzing real-world cases of supply chain management and traceability using software solutions. Reduced risk
Reduced risk accompanied by an increase in certainty of demand can be
achieved. The more information gathered for the forecast (be it from the sales
and marketing team, or via the operations department), the lower the risk of
receiving unprepared-for orders becomes.
(b) Calculation of danger stock levels
By planning ahead and being aware of future orders, a company will be able to
calculate its needed stock levels. A reduction in inventory levels, which in turn
holds significant capital benefits, will be achieved by implementing the
information gained through the forecast.
(c) Production and human resource planning
Fewer staff will be needed to cover demand peaks, for example during the very
busy Christmas holiday shopping season when record companies usually
achieve their highest sales figures (refer to the sales graphs in Annexures C and
D at the end of the thesis). If the forecasting system is accurate, these increased
levels of demand can be anticipated and adequately planned for. The high
amounts of money, which usually needs to be spent on paying over-time
salaries, can then be drastically reduced.
(d) Better demand planning
A definite improvement in the visibility of the customer or the end-user’s
demand can be obtained. By collaborating the research and experience of all
divisions (operations, sales and marketing), a better idea can be formed of what
the needs of customers will be like in the future. This will lead to better planning
through the use of an improved forecasting system.
(e) Improved customer service
Improved customer service will be a direct result

The Future Of Science and Engineering 
The future of science and engineering careers is bright. With the advent of new technologies, there are now many new opportunities.
By following these tips, you can ensure that your career path is a long one:
Keep up with all of the newest developments in your field. If you aren’t aware of changes in your area, you’ll be left behind by those who are. For example, if you’re a software developer, make sure you’re familiar with the latest programming languages and frameworks trends.
Don’t be afraid to try something new. It’s not always easy to learn a new skill or take on a new role. But by doing so, you’ll be able to expand your horizons and gain an edge over your competition.
Stay current with the latest tools and techniques. In today’s world, it’s more important than ever to stay ahead of the curve. If you don’t know what’s happening in your industry, you’ll be at a competitive disadvantage.
The Constantly Changing Education Landscape
As people start to emerge from the devastation of COVID-19, everyone is asking the same question: What should education look like in a post-pandemic world?
The truth is that many aspects of the education system — from where and how we learn to what we study — need to be transformed if we want an education system that is relevant to our current world.
Here are four significant areas in which our education system needs to change:
Students expect to have the ability to learn from anywhere. This is probably one of the most obvious changes brought about by recent events: students now expect to be able to pursue their studies from any location. This versatility is vital for those students who cannot physically attend classes due to health and safety concerns or because they live in remote locations.
Student mobility is also an essential factor here. Students want the opportunity to study abroad, but they don’t necessarily want or need to move overseas permanently. Remote learning options make it easier for students to move around while studying without disrupting their academic progress.
Students expect active learning rather than lectures. Students are looking for different learning experiences, such as more active, hands-on learning rather than traditional lectures.
Our world is constantly changing, and the taught skills must change with it. To create a more equitable, just, and sustainable world, we need to get better at teaching science and engineering. Science education has the power to transform lives, improve health and livelihoods, increase wealth and drive economic growth. It can also help close the gender gap in STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, math).
If we want to change the world of science and engineering for the better, we need to find ways of supporting people who have been excluded from these fields in the past. We must do this by providing equal opportunities for everyone regardless of their race or gender identity. This change means creating spaces where people can engage with science without feeling like outsiders or imposters. We also need more women leaders who will serve as role models for young girls interested in pursuing careers related to STEM subjects.
Academic Freedom to Discover Your Purpose
Open Curriculum Design at Atlantic International University
The Master of Engineering Systems program is offered online via distance learning. After evaluating both academic record and life experience, AIU staff working in conjunction with Faculty and Academic Advisors will assist students in setting up a custom-made program, designed on an individual basis. This flexibility to meet student needs is seldom found in other distance learning programs. Our online program does not require all students to take the same subjects/courses, use the same books, or learning materials. Instead, the online Master of Engineering Systems curriculum is designed individually by the student and academic advisor.
It specifically addresses strengths and weaknesses with respect to market opportunities in the student’s major and intended field of work. Understanding that industry and geographic factors should influence the content of the curriculum instead of a standardized one-fits-all design is the hallmark of AIU’s unique approach to adult education.
